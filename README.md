Python HTTP Server
This project implements a simple HTTP server using Python. The server listens for incoming HTTP requests, handles basic HTTP methods like GET and POST, and responds with appropriate content.

Features
GET Requests: Handles basic GET requests to serve static content.
POST Requests: Handles POST requests to receive and process data.
Custom Headers: Allows sending custom headers with HTTP responses.
Basic Routing: Implements routing for specific URLs.
Requirements
Python 3.9 or higher
Installation
1. Clone this Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Ranganathan-J/HTTP_server.git
2. Navigate into the Project Directory
bash
Copy
Edit
cd http-server-python
3. Run the Server
Run the Python server script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python server.py
By default, the server will run on localhost (127.0.0.1) and listen on port 8080.

4. Access the Server
Open your web browser and go to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8080
Usage
The server will respond to a variety of HTTP requests. Here's an example of how to make a simple GET request using curl or your browser:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
If you have a POST handler implemented, you can send data like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST -d "name=JohnDoe" http://127.0.0.1:8080
Example Response
Hereâ€™s an example response for a GET request to the root endpoint (/):

makefile
Copy
Edit
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 17

Hello, World!
For a POST request, the server might respond with the data it receives or a success message.

Customizing the Server
Change Port: Modify the port number by changing the PORT variable in the server.py file.

python
Copy
Edit
PORT = 8081
Add Routes: To handle more routes, simply add more conditions in the handle_request function to check for different paths (e.g., /about, /contact).

python
Copy
Edit
if "GET /about" in request:
    response = "<html><body><h1>About Us</h1></body></html>"
Serve Static Files: To serve HTML, CSS, and JS files, you can read the file content and send it as the response.

python
Copy
Edit
def serve_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()
