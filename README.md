# Python HTTP Server

This project implements a simple HTTP server using Python. The server listens for incoming HTTP requests, handles basic HTTP methods like **GET** and **POST**, and responds with appropriate content.

## Features

- **GET Requests**: Handles basic GET requests to serve static content.
- **POST Requests**: Handles POST requests to receive and process data.
- **Custom Headers**: Allows sending custom headers with HTTP responses.
- **Basic Routing**: Implements routing for specific URLs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher

## Installation

### 1. Clone this Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ranganathan-J/HTTP_server.git


### Key Points:
1. **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) to wrap your code for better readability.
2. **Headers**: Use `#` and `##` for headers to organize sections.
3. **Inline Code**: Use single backticks (e.g., `curl`) for inline code.
4. **Bullet Points**: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points to list steps or options.
5. **Bold/Italic Text**: Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` for emphasis.

### GitHub Preview:

If you paste this code into your **README.md** file, GitHub will render it as follows:

- The **code blocks** will be properly formatted with syntax highlighting.
- **Headings** will be clear and visually separated.
- **Example outputs** (like the GET/POST responses) will be shown as if they were actual outputs.
  
This will help others understand the usage of the project at a glance while making it visually appealing and easy to follow.
