# Python HTTP Server Example

This is a simple HTTP server written in Python that handles **GET** and **POST** requests. Below is an example of a VB.NET client that interacts with the Python HTTP server.

## VB.NET Client Code

```vbnet
Imports System.Net
Imports System.IO

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        ' Define the server URL
        Dim serverUrl As String = "http://127.0.0.1:8080"

        ' Sending a GET request to the Python HTTP Server
        Dim getResponse As String = SendHttpRequest(serverUrl, "GET")
        Console.WriteLine("GET Response: " & vbCrLf & getResponse)

        ' Sending a POST request to the Python HTTP Server
        Dim postData As String = "name=JohnDoe"
        Dim postResponse As String = SendHttpRequest(serverUrl, "POST", postData)
        Console.WriteLine("POST Response: " & vbCrLf & postResponse)
    End Sub

    Function SendHttpRequest(url As String, method As String, Optional postData As String = "") As String
        Dim request As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(url)
        request.Method = method

        ' If the method is POST, write the data to the request stream
        If method = "POST" AndAlso Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(postData) Then
            Dim byteArray As Byte() = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(postData)
            request.ContentLength = byteArray.Length
            Using dataStream As Stream = request.GetRequestStream()
                dataStream.Write(byteArray, 0, byteArray.Length)
            End Using
        End If

        ' Get the response from the server
        Dim response As WebResponse = request.GetResponse()
        Using dataStream As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()
            Using reader As New StreamReader(dataStream)
                Return reader.ReadToEnd()
            End Using
        End Using
    End Function
End Module

### Key Points:
1. **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) to wrap your code for better readability.
2. **Headers**: Use `#` and `##` for headers to organize sections.
3. **Inline Code**: Use single backticks (e.g., `curl`) for inline code.
4. **Bullet Points**: Use `-` or `*` for bullet points to list steps or options.
5. **Bold/Italic Text**: Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` for emphasis.

### GitHub Preview:

If you paste this code into your **README.md** file, GitHub will render it as follows:

- The **code blocks** will be properly formatted with syntax highlighting.
- **Headings** will be clear and visually separated.
- **Example outputs** (like the GET/POST responses) will be shown as if they were actual outputs.
  
This will help others understand the usage of the project at a glance while making it visually appealing and easy to follow.
